# Smart-Driving-Licence
Our goal was to create a smart driving licence based system that checks the authority and validity of the driver using a smart driving licence card. We decided to go authenticate the user through the fingerprint sensor in which we stored the biometric information into the smart card. Whenever the driver wants to drive the car, the smart card provides the biometric and it is verified with the fingerprint scanner at that moment. This lessens the number of underage drivers, as well as drivers without a valid licence driving the car. We have used arduino UNO, smart card reader and writer(with 64kb) and a fingerprint sensor. We have also created an android app that can communicate with the Arduino via USB or Bluetooth in order to authenticate the driver by sending the biometric data which was collected from the database(firebase) and verified with the fingerprint scanner
